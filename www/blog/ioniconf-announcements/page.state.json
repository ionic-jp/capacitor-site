Expect to see content, tutorials, examples, and more on non-Ionic Framework options from the Capacitor team.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">The new Capacitor mission is to help <em>all</em> web developers build cross-platform apps with their web development skills.</p> <h2 class=\"ui-heading ui-heading-2 ui-theme--editorial\" id=\"capacitor-community\"><a href=\"#capacitor-community\" class=\"heading-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Capacitor Community</h2><p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">One of the biggest challenges with an ecosystem like Capacitor (and like any other popular open source ecosystem) is making sure the community can fill in all the gaps left by the core team with plugins, add-ons, and more.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Yesterday, web announced a new <a href=\"https://github.com/capacitor-community\">Capacitor Community</a> GitHub org and npm scope to curate the best community-supported Capacitor plugins and encourage more developers to build plugins.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">To start, we have a number of great plugins and many are in development. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/capacitor-community/http\">Http</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/capacitor-community/contacts\">Contacts</a>, and <a href=\"https://github.com/capacitor-community/apple-sign-in\">Apple Sign In</a> plugins. We’ve also started moving the <a href=\"https://github.com/capacitor-community/electron\">Electron</a> platform to the community org.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Every project in the Capacitor Community is <em>community maintained and supported</em>, so the Capacitor core team will not be able to provide any kind of community support to any project in here. However, the team is facilitating and in communication with all maintainers.</p> <h2 class=\"ui-heading ui-heading-2 ui-theme--editorial\" id=\"capacitor-elements\"><a href=\"#capacitor-elements\" class=\"heading-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Capacitor Elements</h2><p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">We announced Capacitor Elements, an upcoming project to bring operating-system level UI experiences to every Capacitor app, regardless of the web framework or UI library an app uses.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">These components will be powered by Ionic Framework under the hood, but will be fully compatible and not conflict with any modern UI library.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">The goal is to provide the same types of utility APIs that the operating system would to a traditional native developer, such as Action Sheets, Bottom Drawers, Alerts, Modals, Cameras, and more.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">This makes a Capacitor app feel native right away regardless of whether the app framework provides these controls.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Stay tuned for more updates soon!</p> <h2 class=\"ui-heading ui-heading-2 ui-theme--editorial\" id=\"deploy-to-app-store-for-capacitor\"><a href=\"#deploy-to-app-store-for-capacitor\" class=\"heading-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Deploy to App Store for Capacitor</h2><p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">We announced that <a href=\"https://ionicframework.com/docs/appflow/destinations/intro\">Deploy to App Store</a>, a powerful new feature available in Ionic’s DevOps service <a href=\"https://useappflow.com/\">Appflow</a> that enables developers to push builds to the Apple App Store and Google Play Store, is now available to all paid Appflow plans.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">This feature is a significant boost to teams frustrated with the manual and tedious app store publishing process, or for teams that wish to automate app store submission as part of their CI/CD pipeline.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Appflow now fully supports Capacitor, and Capacitor is quickly becoming the preferred native runtime when using Appflow.</p> <h2 class=\"ui-heading ui-heading-2 ui-theme--editorial\" id=\"updated-site-domain-and-docs\"><a href=\"#updated-site-domain-and-docs\" class=\"heading-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Updated Site, Domain, and Docs</h2><p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">We’ve updated the Capacitor site and moved to a new domain (<a href=\"https://capacitorjs.jp\">capacitorjs.jp</a>) and Twitter handle (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/capacitorjs\">@capacitorjs</a>).</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">We also rolled out <a href=\"/docs\">updated documentation</a> as we embark on a documentation overhaul.</p> <h2 class=\"ui-heading ui-heading-2 ui-theme--editorial\" id=\"stay-tuned\"><a href=\"#stay-tuned\" class=\"heading-anchor\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></a>Stay tuned</h2><p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Capacitor is quickly becoming the focal point of Ionic’s open source offering, and we’re investing heavily in it. The team itself has grown in the last few weeks and we are truly just getting started on our mission to enable all web developers to build cross-platform apps for the app store and the web.</p> <p class=\"ui-paragraph ui-paragraph--prose ui-paragraph-3\">Stay tuned for a ton more Capacitor updates in the coming months!</p>"},"components":["announcement-bar","site-backdrop","docs-dropdown","blog-subnav","blog-post","ion-icon","docs-search","more-button","site-header","site-root","capacitor-site"]}
